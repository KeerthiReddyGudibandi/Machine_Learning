# Weather Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms
## Description
This project involves predicting weather conditions using machine learning models. Comparing the performance of Naive Bayes and XGBoost classifiers, we determine which model provides more accurate weather predictions based on the weather data.

## Data
The dataset used includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, chance of rain

## Models
- **Naive Bayes**: This algorithm is very widely renowned for its ability to predict many classes. Here, we can forecast the likelihood of several target variable classes. 
- **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm that performs well on large datasets with complex relationships.

XGBoost outperforms Naive Bayes in terms of accuracy, demonstrating better performance in predicting weather conditions.
